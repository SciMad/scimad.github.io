I have to be nerd, right? Programmer's got to be nerdy! Of course, I won't open up gedit to impress my sister. That's not it. I researched a little before actually jumping into vi if it is worth investing time upon and yeah, it's debatable, but what I found true; which is true in general as well; is the more you invest your time, the better you will be and once you master it, you will start using vim like a language, like talking and giving command to the editor. That clicked the *yes* button. Once I started using it, I found the navigation keys being used in many other gui applications as well as other editor's as well, as plugins or as "vi mode". Anyway, I am enjoying it.

I am using NeoVIM; nvim.
