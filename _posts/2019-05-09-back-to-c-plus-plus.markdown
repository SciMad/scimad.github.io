When I wrote [my first C++ project][buddhichal] (Buddhichal / Chess, 2015), I thought I had understood OOP. I thought, I had understood the notion of objects and classes. I had, a little. But only when my friend Prakash gave it a look, I knew how primitive (C-like) it was in sense of actually using OOP features and design principles. Objects were not segregrated in terms of thier responsibilites. I realized that the dependencies of methods were not clear (in my mind and in the program henceforth). Many `static` elements were used. Part of the problem was also because I have used `OpenGL` {which is a C(Not C++ / OOP)-library} to render graphics for project.

So, when my code was reviewed, Prakash got disappointed. I got more disappointed. To the extent that I never *really* looked back to C++ with full enthusiasm. The most painful thing about that all is I really didn't study and use C++ Templates and carried a guilt of not doing C++ really well for all these years.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

***I was about to delete this post, but I thought "Why? Why not let someone see how blogs are made in jekyll? And also, why delete a post that's already there?"***
