# Newton's Second Law of Motion

*Newton's second law of motion* states that there exists frames of reference in which the motion of the particle is described by the differential equation

$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F} = \frac{d\textbf{p}}{dt} = \dot{\textbf{p}}
\end{equation}
$$

Or,

$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F} = \frac{d}{dt} \left(m\textbf{v}\right)
\end{equation}
$$

# Definition of angular momentum

The angular momentum of the particle about point *O*, denoted by **L**, is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{L} = \textbf{r} \times {\textbf{p}}
\end{equation}
$$

# Definition of Moment of force

The moment of force or torque about *O*, denoted by **N**, is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{N} = \textbf{r} \times {\textbf{F}}
\end{equation}
$$

Taking the cross product with **r** the equation of **F**, we can show that

$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{N} = \dot{\textbf{L}}
\end{equation}
$$

where, both **L** and **N** depend on the point *O* about which the moments are taken.

The conservation theorem for linear and angular momentum of a particle follows from respective equations above.


**TODO: Add something about Energy COnservation Theorem for a particle**
