# I want to improve my mathematics and physics skills and knowledge!

So, I am going to solve at least 5 physics / mathematics problems every week for 52 weeks, no matter what.

For this, I have decided the following things for that:

- socialize less
- deactivate facebook for a year (or forever?)
- no Youtube videos
- less hangouts

Problems from each week will follow.
